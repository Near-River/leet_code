This is a dynamic programming question. Usually, solving and fully understanding a dynamic programming problem is a 4 step process:
    Start with the recursive backtracking solution
    Optimize by using a memoization table (top-down dynamic programming)
    Remove the need for recursion (bottom-up dynamic programming)
    Apply final tricks to reduce the time / memory complexity
